  <p>Last night was pretty great!</p>
  <p>Fort Worth Lodge had its stated meeting night, and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many visitors - at first only minorly so, then majorly so. I shared the elevator with three or four brothers from Handley Lodge on the way up to our dining hall... Then I quickly realized, as the time went on, that they were coming out in force! Our little dining hall was packed. Handley Lodge brought out 15 brothers to come help take the travel gavel.</p>
  <p>The Grand Lodge of Texas (AF&AM) 64th District Traveling Gavel:</p>

  <p>The room was abuzz with excitement. Many of the Fort Worth Members were whispering to each other over the food - cooked on the Fort Worth Lodge #148 Smoker, of course - as we were and are totally psyched to get so many visitors. I pro-tem'd the Senior Deacon's part, and began running around the dining hall, collecting names and titles as fast as I could.</p>
  <p>The time to file into the lodge room came, and we ran out of aprons! We had to dig in the closet for a third box of aprons. We had a total attendance of 54 brothers. Once visitors were introduced, all first time visitors were given a Fort Worth Lodge pin.</p>
  <p>One of my little treasures, the Fort Worth Lodge #148 pin that was given to me the night that I was raised:</p>

  <p>We blasted through the regular business, with some minor delays during a slightly more free-form portion of lodge, and then got to the presentation of the Travel Gavel. Unfortunately, I don't have pictures of that, since we were in open lodge at the time (meaning photography is verboten), but it was wonderful. In addition to the travel gavel on the plaque, Fort Worth Lodge has decided to toss in the Mega Gavel as well. Now, in addition to the <a href="http://www.64th.org/traveling-gavel-rules/">existing stipulations</a> on the gavel, the Mega Gavel will be travelling with the regular plaque. After our <a href="http://www.handonahkur.com/">Brother Hando Nahkur</a> played a very stirring piece, we closed out and Hollywooded for the camera. All in all, a great night in Texas Masonry.</p>
