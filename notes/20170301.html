		<li>March 4th is the UCLA Annual International Conference. Subject is: 300 years of freemasonry, and they are tracing the complex evolution of the craft from its public inception in 1717 to today. Grand Horizon Ballroom at UCLA. See more at the <a href="https://www.freemason.org/events/uclaConference.htm">Masons of California page on the subject.</a></li>
		<li>March 16th – Dufferin Lodge #291 in Ontario is putting on a play depicting a lodge meeting in 1774’s London. Apparently they actually have an 18th century degree team, which is awesome. If you're up in that area, reach out to them at www.dufferinlodge.com</li>
		<li>There is now an effort to raise funds for the restoration of the building called the <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/02/birminghams_colored_masonic_te.html">Colored Masonic Temple</a> in Birmingham, Alabama. The building was opened in 1924 by the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free & Accepted Masons of Alabama. It’s been the home of many organizations – obviously the MWPHGLFAMoAL, but also offices for doctors, lawyers, accountants, a barbershop, billiards room, and most notably the NAACP. Duke Ellington and Count Basie regularly played there. In the segregated South, the building was seen as a symbol of black prosperity, and today is considered to be a major landmark in the Civil Rights Movement. The MWPHGLFAMoAL is working in conjuction with the National Park Service to try and get the building restored. There is a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/princehallmasonictemple">GoFundMe</a> for the effort to remove the lead paint and asbestos from the building. The Grand Lodge is hoping to get federal and state historic tax credits for the renovation. Best of luck to the Grand Lodge and MWGM Hawkins.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.citynews.ca/2017/02/28/man-charged-3-counts-arson-masonic-lodge-fire/">Weston Temple, a lodge building in Toronto, was the target of an arson attack.</a> A guy threw a molotov cocktail through the basement window, which started a small fire. As far as the Toronto police know, this is not connected to the fire at the Islamic information center during the same week, but the perpetrator is suspected of other arsons in the neighborhood. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/5wt30b/toronto_masonic_lodge_fire_bombed/?st=izr8v1vo&sh=54321afa">reddit thread.</a> According to a brother from that lodge, the dining room is demolished. No word yet on the condition of the Lodge room itself, but it was right above the dining hall. The lodge serves multiple lodges in the area. No word yet on whether or not there's a GoFundMe or anything set up yet, but we'll talk about it as we get more info.</li>

Ownership is being transferred to the United Methodist Children's Home. All the kids (15) will get to keep living there, and the staff is being retained.</li>

Just to recap, the Italian government is accusing them of being involved with the Cosa Nostra, 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra.</li>

	<li>Questions</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Robert William Marshall of Waco Lodge #92: Are you guys mad that Waco 92 member Josephus Steiner murdered Brother Ripley Arnold, the founder of Fort Worth?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Brother Steiner was one of the earliest members of Waco Lodge #92. Born in Maryland, educated in Ohio, got his medical degree in Pennsylvania. He served in the Mexican-American war as a surgeon, which is how he ended up in Texas. He ended up opening a medical practice pretty shortly afterwards.</li>
			<li>Brother Arnold was born in Mississippi, and educated at West point. He was an excellent singer and drinker, and as a West Point cadet, fought a duel in a bar. In Florida, he got his first taste of army life. He eventually married a fourteen year-old and five kids. While this was going on, he was made a captain, and served under the command of Brother General William J Worth.</li>
			<li>The two brothers eventually ran into each other. Brother Arnold (now a Major) ended up being Brother Steiner's commanding officer and they hated each other's guts. Eventually Steiner filed a report suggesting that Arnold was stealing from the army by selling military horses and pocketing the cash. Arnold was incense and attempted to have Steiner arrested for public intoxication.</li>
			<li>Of course, this ended up in a shoot-out, which ended up with Arnold dead. Steiner repeatedly no-showed his court-martial dates, and even was "rescued" from arresting law enforcement officers by a group of men from Waco 92. Steiner was eventually found not guilty of murder in a civilian court and was hailed as a hero by the people of Waco.</li>
			<li>Steiner lived a pretty eventful life after all of that, too. To learn more, please read about Brother Steiner at http://www.wacomasonic.org/josephus-steiner/</li>
