		<li>March 4th is the UCLA Annual International Conference. Subject is: 300 years of freemasonry, and they are tracing the complex evolution of the craft from its public inception in 1717 to today. Grand Horizon Ballroom at UCLA. See more at the <a href="https://www.freemason.org/events/uclaConference.htm">Masons of California page on the subject.</a></li>
		<li>March 16th – Dufferin Lodge #291 in Ontario is putting on a play depicting a lodge meeting in 1774’s London. Apparently they actually have an 18th century degree team, which is awesome. If you're up in that area, reach out to them at www.dufferinlodge.com</li>
		<li>There is now an effort to raise funds for the restoration of the building called the <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/02/birminghams_colored_masonic_te.html">Colored Masonic Temple</a> in Birmingham, Alabama. The building was opened in 1924 by the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free & Accepted Masons of Alabama. It’s been the home of many organizations – obviously the MWPHGLFAMoAL, but also offices for doctors, lawyers, accountants, a barbershop, billiards room, and most notably the NAACP. Duke Ellington and Count Basie regularly played there. In the segregated South, the building was seen as a symbol of black prosperity, and today is considered to be a major landmark in the Civil Rights Movement. The MWPHGLFAMoAL is working in conjuction with the National Park Service to try and get the building restored. There is a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/princehallmasonictemple">GoFundMe</a> for the effort to remove the lead paint and asbestos from the building. The Grand Lodge is hoping to get federal and state historic tax credits for the renovation. Best of luck to the Grand Lodge and MWGM Hawkins.</li>
