			<li>The Young County Masonic Lodge #485 Tenth Annual Scholarship Auction was a resounding success. They held it on the 11th, as we'd previously mentioned in the events sections, and they broke every record this year after all the numbers were crunched. They sold 1378 lots totalling $158K worth of merchandise, had 455 registered buyers, and had over 2000 people in attendance. In May, they will be presenting several scholarships to students in each of the three high schools in Young County. Brother Weldon Floyd writes, "Masonry was on display for all to see" and extended his thanks to the members and their families.</li>
			<li>The Texas Lodge of Research had their Stated Meeting on Saturday at the Dallas Scottish Rite Temple.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>National</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Quincy, Massachusetts. After last Friday, a man and a juvenile are facing multiple firearms charges, and charges of disorderly conduct / resisting arrest after vandalizing an abandoned Masonic Temple by firing a shot through a door of the building. Nobody was hurt.</li>
			<li>Monday marks the 164th anniversary of Albert Pike becoming a Scottish Rite Mason on March 20, 1853, by receiving the 29 degrees from Albert Mackey. Mackey recited the degrees to Pike, and Pike transcribed them. Thanks to Brother Jason Mitchell for that fact!</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Abroad</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Russia. Vitaly Milonov, a member of the Russian State Duma (lower house of their Federal Assembly), has proposed to target Russian lodges to see if they are complying with laws that restrict the abilities of foreign and international political organizations.</li>
				<ul>
				<li>"It is not a secret that the Freemason Order is one of the world's oldest public and political organizations. According to information from open sources one of their main goals is the creation of the New World Order and the global government based on Masonic principles. In other words, this mystical public organization that has branches and representation offices in our country, openly declares its intention to intervene with democratic processes."</li>
				<li>He also pointed out that the Russian state has historically controlled and/or outlawed Masonic activity.</li>

	<li>Questions</li>
		<ul>
		<li>From Brother Billy Hamilton: do you think that the 1980 scandal of the Vatican Bank associate Michele Sindona and the clandestine P2 lodge (Propaganda Due Lodge, which was exppelled by the Grand Orient of Italy in 1976) might be used as an excuse by the Italian government for their actions? Sindona was found to have links with the Sicilian Mafia. Perhaps this shows how the dangers of clandestine Lodges and their activities can jeapordize the reputations of regular masons?</li>
		<li>How does your lodge represent the network on the pillars / how do they represent the pillars in general? Pomgrant vs pomegranate. Some states, like Pennsylvania, don't have a representation of the pillars at all.</li>
		<li>How should you dress for your interview, as a candidate? How should you dress for lodge?</li>
		<li>Please send us more questions at info148@fortworth148.org or on our Facebook page!</li>
