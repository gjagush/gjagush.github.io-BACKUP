			<li><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/04/04/fort-collins-vandalism-hate-crime/">Fort Collins, Colorado</a> - the Masonic Temple in Fort Collins has been vandalized. Black spray paint has been used to graffitti on the steps and pillars of the building's front. The pillars were defaced with upside-down crosses, and the steps have had the phrase "great tribulation is at hand" sprayed on them. Police are currently investigating this as a hate crime.</li>

				<ul>
				<li><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/king-solomon-mines-bible-timna-dung/">From National Geographic</a></li>
				<li>three thousand year old manure in the Timna Valley of Israel was discovered during the excavation of an ancient mining camp.</li>
				<li>There are remnants of several wall structures there.</li>
				<li>This was previously considered to be a Bronze Age site - tied into the New Kingdom of Egypt in the 13th Century BC.</li>
				<li>However, carbon-dating appears to show that it was active in the 10th century BC - the time of David and Solomon.</li>
				<li>The industrial level of copper production at the site, along with the seeds & pollen found in the dung, show that this was very possibly part of a large-scale, long-distance trade arrangement.</li>

				</ul>
			<li>History</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Founding</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Catholic priest, Father Michael McGivney</li>
					<li>1882</li>
					<li>Connecticut</li>
					<li>Originally inspired by the need to take care of widows and orphans in immigrant communities</li>
					<li>support structure for Catholics (ostracized by American society at the time)</li>
					<li>alternative to Masonry due to Papal prohibition for Catholics to be Masons</li>
					<li>Namesake is Christopher Columbus, both as hope that one day, Catholics wouldn't be treated the way they were being treated, and as a reminder to both Catholics and Protestants that Catholics were a key part in the birth of the US.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Early 20th Century Oath Hoax</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Anti-Catholic prejudice</li>
					<li>Old oath previously falsely attributed to the Jesuits</li>
					<li>Circulated primarily by the Klu Klux Klan in an anti-Catholic effort</li>
					<li>Summary</li>
						<ul>
						<li>denouces authority of Protestant government leaders</li>
						<li>generally anti-Protestant</li>
						<li>anti-Mason</li>
						<li>spying on Protestants using Catholic women</li>
						<li>allegiance only to the Pope</li>
						<li>"I do further promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly and openly against all heretics, Protestants and Masons, as I am directed to do to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex, or condition, and that will hang, bum, waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women, and  crush their infants' heads against the wails in order to annihilate their execrable race. That when the same can not be done openly, I will secretly use the poisonous cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard, or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agents of the Pope or superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Father of the Society of Jesus."</li>
