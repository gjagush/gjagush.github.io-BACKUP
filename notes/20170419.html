			<li>The Illinois Masonic Children's Home in La Grange, Illinois is closing. Due to policies that focus more on keeping families together (which is good thing), many orphanages and homes have experienced less and less need to house kids. The Children's Home in La Grange is no exception. Another home, in Murphysboro, is also being closed. A social services agency will be buying the home in order to provide housing and care for the kids that still live there. http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/la-grange/news/ct-dlg-illinois-masonic-home-closing-tl-0420-20170412-story.html</li>

				<li>This happened on April 13th.</li>
				<li>The Grand Master and multiple other Grand Officers arrived in person to seize the charter.</li>
				<li>Most of the commentary from those in the know seems to indicate that the GL of VA is taking actions that are within reason.</li>
