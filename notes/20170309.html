		<li>WE STILL HAVE THE TRAVEL GAVEL. COME AND GET IT. Our stated meeting is this coming Monday. Bring seven or more brothers, and you get to take it home. Of course, we'll take it right back.</li>
		<li>March 6th was the 242nd anneversary of Prince Hall being made a Mason. A happy "birthday" to him, so to speak, and positive vibes to all our Prince Hall-Affiliated Brothers.</li>
		<s><li>Camera Hidden in Ladies' Room in Louisville (Kentucky) Scottish Rite Restrooms</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Multiple news outlets are talking about a lawsuit against the Scottish Rite Valley of Louisville.</li>
				<li>The inident occurred in the fall of last year, but folks are only just not finding out about it.</li>
				<li>The cameras were hiddeninside of the coat hooks.</li>
				<li>The video footage was reviewed and the person that installed the hidden camera appeared to have been wearing a red KCCH cap, but his face couldn't been seen.</li>

		<li>700 Year Old Templar Cave Found Behind Rabbit Hole in British Countryside</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You may have seen this article from mirror.co.uk</li>
				<li>Take a huge grain of salt with this! /u/cryptoengineer on reddit says:<p>"A quick search shows that these caves (Cayton Caves) have been knwn for at least five years, possibly much longer. Their age is unknown, and a Templar connection [is] completely speculative. A more likely origin is as a 'folly' in the mid-1800s."</p></li>
				<li>However, it is pretty cool and I'll continue to pretend that it's templar stuff because that's more fun.</li>
				<li>The cave is under a farmer's field and is only about a meter underground.</li>
				<li>It's made out of a big network of underground walkways.</li>
				<li>The entrance is tiny and looks just like a rabbit hole.</li>
				<li>It's near Shropshire Village in Albrighton</li>
				<li>There are inscriptions all over the walls.</li>

		<li>OPTIONAL: The Quest for Judas Maccabeus</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-Christian alternative to Commandery</li>
				<li>Founded in New York State in the 1970s by Brother Herman Sarachan</li>
				<li>Required one to be a Royal Arch Mason</li>
				<li>Beginning had brothers from the New York Grand Chapter, Council, and Commandery involved</li>
				<li>Intially it seems that it never really made it out of the state of New York, but there were some references that said it had expanded into New Jersey and Connecticut, and that several states, like California and Ohio, had expressed interest (although there is no evidence to suggest they chartered Assemblages of their own).</li>
				<li>I have made contact with one brother that had been in the order, and one who knew a member of the order</li>
				<li>Most of the guys invoved in OOJM seemed to have passed away and/or lack an online presence</li>
				<li>Eventually after reaching out to some very helpful brothers, I acquired a copy of the ritual... for TEXAS. It was a 2007 revision of the work by the late Brother Cliff Cameron, former Grand Historian of the Texas Grand Council.</li>
				<li>There are two degrees - the Order of David and the Order of Judas Maccabeus. There was going to be a third Order, but brother Sarachan died before he could finish it.</li>
				<li>Currently Brother Arturo De Hoyos is working with the Grand College of Rites to find out if there are any Assemblages of the Order left, and if it's truely dead, they'll going to preserve it in the Collectanea.</li>
				<li>You can read more by checking out my material on it by going to texanmason.com. Go to "Archive" at the bottom of the page, and then look for the post titled "The Quest for Judas Maccabeus." I'll link the post in the show notes.</li>
				<li>Anyway, there is a contingent of brothers in New York that is trying to revive the Order. I am in contact with one of them and they are all very busy preparing. Those of them that are not yet Royal Arch Masons are in the process of becoming so, in order to recieve the Orders.</li>
				<li>If you know of any Assemblages of the Order, please reach out to us.</li>

		<li>What does the Monitor say?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Monitor is actually censored in regards to this, tread carefully.</li>
			<li><img src="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/lightfoots_manual_of_the_lodge_files/image017.gif"></li>
			<li>There is a specific demand made of the candidate that illustrates CHARITY.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Relevant Lightfoot quote</li>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="/ref/lightfootnortheastcorner.html">North-East Corner</a></li>
			<li>The Brahmans believed that anyone who is terminally ill should travel in northeasterly direction, consuming only water, until their body withered away and their soul was "united with the Supreme." A similar idea is presented here - even if mortal life has ended, the brother has begun to build his spiritual temple.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is the most important stone of the building.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is perfectly square and strong.</li>
			<li>Cubes are an emblem of truth.</li>
			<li>The NE corner is between the North (darkness) and the East (Light)</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is constantly checked with the plumb, square, and level.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>How to walk and act as such</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Read your VSL.</li>
			<li>Read other people's VsSL.</li>
			<li>Meditate - think of nothing</li>
			<li>Contemplate - think of the degree symbols and lessons</li>
			<li>Meet and converse with well-informed brethren.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What does it mean to walk and act as a Mason as opposed to the average profane person?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>As masons, we are held to a higher standard.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Why does this matter, anyway?</li>

	  <li>"There are good men and bad men of all nationalities, creeds, and colors; and if this world of ours is ever to become what we hope some day it may become, it must be by the general recognition that the man's heart and soul, the man's worth and actions, determine his standing."<p>   -- President Teddy Roosevelt, 1903</p></li>
