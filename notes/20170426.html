		<li>Masonry Gone Hollywood! - masonry in movies and television</li>
		<li>1915 - Are you a Mason?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Summary from Wikipedia was nice and short and too good not to read in full - Frank Perry (Barrymore) discovers that his wife (Helen Freeman) desires him to become a Mason. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Perry goes out for several nights to carouse and have fun while telling his wife that he is undergoing initiation at the Masonic lodge. When his wife invites her father, a Grand Master of the Masons, for a visit, Frank goes to comedic lengths to avoid being found out. The farce is magnified by the circumstance that his father-in-law has also been lying about his Masonic association. They rereleased the movie again a couple of decades later with sound.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>1916</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Popular cartoon character called Bobby Bumps</li>
			<li>Bobby shows up at a farm with a goat, which he can't seem to get into the barn without tricking it. Bobby's friend, who is this horrendous example of blackface in old cartoons shows up, and Bobby trys to get him to join an a lodge. He shows him an apron and tells him that all regular Masons wear aprons. His friend says, yeah, sure, I'll join, and they tie the apron on him backwards.  He's concerned about the whole deal, but Bobby tells him that this lodge does everything differently. So now we know that Bobby Bumps was clandestine. Bobby blindfolds his friend and tells him, "wait here til I get the third degree." He then brings out the goat and tells his friend to bend over. His friend is expecting to get paddled, but Bobby tries to get the goat to headbutt his buddy in the behind. His buddy, however, gets turned around, and headbutts the goat, knocking it unconscious. His friend is super psyched at having "passed" the hazing and Bobby gets mad, and chases his friends all over the place. There's running around near a cliff in involved, the kid in blackface dances a lot, and then a big bear shows up to eat them. Bobby saves his buddy on thhe condition that he'll "join the lodge" and his buddy agrees. Bobby saves his friend, but gets in trouble himself, and agrees to let his buddy initiate him in return. At home, they both blindfold themselves in order to get headbutted in the buttocks, but both jump at the same time, and trick the goat into falling into a bucket of water.</li>
		<li>1943 - Forces Occultes</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Anti-Masonic film from Vichy France. Full title in English is "Occult Forces: The Mysteries of Freemasonry Unveiled for the First Time on Screen." The story follows a young guy who joins Masonry to save his career, but he learns that the Freemasons are conspriring with the Jews and Anglo countries in order to subvert the peace in continental Europe. The movie was actually directed by a guy who had been an officer (Venerable) of his lodge for 8 years but left. The Nazi "Propaganda Abteilung" comissioned him to direct it. After France was liberated, he and a bunch of other people were executed for collaborating with the Nazis.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>1999 - End of Days</li>
			<ul>
			<li>ARNIE. Schwartzenegger movie. He plays this cop called Jericho Cane who has to save a girl from Satan, and he carrys around an amulet. I actually wanted to copy the exact quote from that: "Now this amulet is from a masonic order in the former sub-heredom of the Vatican Knights, the Knights of the Holy See. They await the return of the dark angel to earth." There's also a big 'ol Baphomet right at the beginning of the movie, which is not Masonic, but commonly mis-associated with us.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>2001 - Affair of the Necklace.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Hilary Swank movie - based on the event called the Affair of the Diamond necklace, something that helped the French monarchy look even worse during the period preceding the French Revolution.</li>
			<li>Christopher Walken plays Count Cagliostro, who calls himself Grand Master of the Illuminati. Cagliostro was actually the alias of a dude called Guiseppe Balsamo who was an Italian adventurer, magic, alchemist, and occultist.</li>
			<li>One of the other characters has a desk covered in details of working tools and emblems.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>2003 - Big Fish</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Story about a dying guy trying to patch things up with his son. It's a lot more complicated than that, but you get it.</li>
			<li>When he grows up and leaves town, there's a parade, and there's a bunch of shriners in the Mystic Wheels - st gokarts.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>2006 - The DaVinci Code</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Not strictly masonic but there's just so much crazy that happens in this movie that it's hard to even begin.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>2009 - Brother's War</li>
			<ul>
			<li>This takes place during the end of WWII, when the Western Allies and the Soviet Union were racing towards Berlin. A British Army Major gets imprisoned by the Russians for finding a secret that the Russians were keeping. While he's imprisoned, me meets a German captain who has a square and compasses tattoo and they collaborate to escape with a Polish nurse. At one point the Major uses a pretty interesting phrase. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>2013 - The Freemason</li>
			<ul>
			<li>This banker gets brutally murdered, and this writer teams up with a detective to solve it. I haven't had a chance to see this movie yet, but they have to dive into the "cryptic world of Freemasonry." They interview a Grandmaster, and a 32nd degree mason. There's a whole cabal of bankers involved, etc. The writer supposedly has family ties or something to Masonry, and the tagline of the movie is hilariously great: "Freemasons don't control everything, only the things that matter."</li>
