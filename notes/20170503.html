			<li>Fort Worth #148 had a master's degree on Monday for our brother Mark (leaving his last name out for privacy for now). It was great and we got multiple brothers playing parts that were new to them, which was super cool. A lot of the guys involved are super flexible and they pulled off a killer degree. We're really looking forwards to watching and helping Mark on his journey as our newest Master Mason.</li>

			<li>The Fort Worth Scottish Rite Gun Club had a great time at the North Richland Hills location of Total Shooting Sports. I believe they are planning another shoot sometime in June. This event is not restricted to masters - EAs, Fellowcrafts, feel free to come along, and bring a friend! We'll update y'all with more details as they come out.</li>

			<li>Shriners Hospitals - The scientists at the Shriners Hospitals have developed an arthritis vaccine! This really benefits kids with juvenile arthritis and is designed to fight arthritis using stem cells modified for autonomous regenerative therapy. Human clinical trials are still a few years away, with the end goal of being able to grow living bone, cartilage, and so forth. Check out shrinershospitalsforchildren.org for more info.</li>
			<li>Solomon, Kansas - A man has been arrested for the embezzlement of over $150,000 from the Salina County Masonic Temple Foundation. He was hired as the Foundations's treasurer last July, and began embezzling funds only a few months later. Suspiscions arose in early April and were quickly investigated. The police have stated that the individual in question was using foundation funds for airplane trips, hotel stays, and subscriptions to pornographic websites. Additionally, he had allegedly been writing checks to himself and a regalia business he owned. Guard your West Gates, folks.</li>

		<li>Abroad</li>

			<li>Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada - there has been a break-in at the Masonic Temple. The whole place was ransacked and a charity box for the Shriners Children's Hospitals was looted. Broken glass was left everywhere and many cupboards, cabinets, and display cases were damaged, but nobody was hurt. The RCMP are on the case and if you're a Canadian listener, and you learn something helpful about this case, please contact them at 1-800-222-8477.</li>
            <li>New York City, New York, 'Murica - The Grand Lodge of New York, F&AM, has suspended recognition of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, AF&AM. This happened during their annual communication, which was this past Monday. This is due to an issue that they are having with the Grand Lodge of Scotland in the country of Lebanon. Since Lebanon has no Grand Lodge of its own, there are almost twenty Grand Lodges operating there - including New York and Scotland. Three guys who had been expelled from the GL of NY joined the GL of Scotland in Lebanon. The  straw that finally broke the camel's back is that the GL of Scotland is currently in the process of getting these guys involved at the Grand officer level in this provincial Grand Lodge. Something slightly similar happened back in 2008 when the Grand Lodge of New York suspended (and eventually restored) recognition of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia, due to NY's claim that Lebanon was their exclusive territory. There is a really interesting response from DC's GL to NY regarding THAT particular incident on Chris Hodapp's website, Freemasons For Dummies. It's an interesting read.</li>
