	<ul>
	<li>Formal Background Checks</li>
		<ul>
		<li>GLNY starting new program with "Guarding the West Gate" at <a href="https://guardingthewestgate.com/">https://guardingthewestgate.com/</a></li>
		<li>GLNY background checks are voluntary on part of the candidate.</li>
		<li>GLMA, GLVA, GLWI, others, have mandatory checks.</li>
		<li>GLTX historical issue with requiring background check is related to Fair Credit Reporting Act. If someone is denied membersip or service because of a background check, they have the legal right to appeal that. However, Masonic law doesn't really provide for appealing a blackball vote. Is it possible that lodges would be open to lawsuits for not complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act?</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Belief in God / Higher Power</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Pretty much non-negotiable</li>
		<li>What about pantheism, polytheism, etc? What does GLTX say?</li>
		<li>Talk with the candidate about this.</li>
		<li>Flying spaghetti monster, Jedism, "science"</li>
		<li>What's Texas' official stance? - unusual</li>
			<ul>
			<li>"Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you firmly believe in the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the Divine authenticity of the Holy Scripture?"</li>
			<li><a href="/docs/GLTXlaw.pdf">Art. 397. (434).</a> Religious Belief. A firm belief in the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the divine authenticity of the Holy Scriptures is indispensably necessary before a candidate can be initiated, but this Grand Lodge does not presume to prescribe any canonical books or what part thereof are inspired. It is the policy of this Grand Lodge to permit a candidate whose religious persuasion is based upon other than the Holy Bible to be obligated upon the book of his chosen faith, and same may be situated upon the Altar in front of the Holy Bible during the conferral of the three degrees of Masonry. In which event, all esoteric references to “The Holy Bible” during the conferral of the degree(s) and the lessons appropriate thereto shall be substituted with “The Book of your (my) Faith.”
			</ul>
		<li>It's cool to cater to a candidate's religious beliefs, but make sure that you do so respectfully. Let them take the lead on that.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>"Should your religious belief be based upon other than the Holy Bible, please bring the “Book of Faith” appropriate to your religious persuasion when you appear for the conferral of your degrees."</li>
