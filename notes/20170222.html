	<ul>
	<li>Fort Worth Lodge has the travel gavel, come at us bro. EA Degree on Monday, give it a shot.</li>
	<li>Brother Chris Hodapp's blog, freemasonsfordummies.blogspot.com, <a href="http://freemasonsfordummies.blogspot.com/2017/02/italian-government-attempting-anti.html">what I'm calling "The Italian Affair"</a></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Italy is using anti-Mafia laws against Masonry in Italy.</li>
		<li>Currently the accusations are that Masonry in Italy has been infiltrated by the Calabrian mafia - no evidence yet to prove this.</li>
		<li>Stefano Bisi (Grand Master, Grand Orient of Italy) is refusing to provide member data on the bases of privacy, as is Antonio Binnie (Grand Master, Grand Lodge of Italy).</li>
		<li>They are backed up by a 2009 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.</li>
		<li>Fabio Venzi (Grand Master, Regular Grand Lodge of Italy) is ready to collaborate with government.</li>
		<li>L'Espresso, a very influential weekly magazine, published an editorial titled "Abolish Freemasonry," to which MW Bisi reponded, saying that this kind of behaviour is dangerous to free thought and democracy, and that "We will not be intimidated or influenced by anyone."</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Also from Brother Chris Hodapp's blog, freemasonsfordummies.blogspot.com<a href="http://freemasonsfordummies.blogspot.com/2017/02/gm-of-florida-again-rescinds.html">the story of Florida / Cuba recognition</a></li>
		<ul>
		<li>GLoFL F&AM recognized the Grad Logia de Cuba in December 2016, including mutual visitation.</li>
		<li>As of February 16th, GLoFL no longer recognizes GLdCu due to GLdCu's "failure to renounce the clandestine lodges operating" in Florida.</li>
		<li>The lodges in question are lodges of Cuban exiles who are not in the Grand Lodge of Florida.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Anti-Masonry: <a href="http://www.churchmilitant.com/video/episode/vortex-freemasons-and-scared-shepherds">"FREEMASONS AND SCARED SHEPHERDS"</a></li>
		<ul>
		<li>Organization called Church Militant is meeting in Southern California this weekend to talk about the effects of freemasons on the Catholic Church.</li>
		<li>Their basic premise is that freemasonry is intrinsically tied to the Catholic Church's failed leadership for a host of reasons.</li>
		<li>Supposedly the Craft is responsible for the French Revolution, Bolshevik Revolution, Sexual Revolution, etc, and had won every battle it's had wiwth the Catholic Church.</li>
		<li>This is all mostly hilarious.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Listener Questions</b></p>
	<p>Brother Billy Hamilton:</p>
	<p>During the stated meeting, several masonic education topics or certifications that were mentioned. I don’t recall exactly what the names were…I believe that one was called ALL, and another covered the topic of opening and closing the lodge, one was referred to as having an A, B, and C level. Would it be possible to find out more information about these and any other ways that I can learn more? I am always in search of more light in Masonry.</p>
	<p>--- Talk about certs and mention dates in events after podcast.</p>

	<p><b>Discussion Points</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Formal Background Checks</li>
		<ul>
		<li>GLNY starting new program with "Guarding the West Gate" at <a href="https://guardingthewestgate.com/">https://guardingthewestgate.com/</a></li>
		<li>GLNY background checks are voluntary on part of the candidate.</li>
		<li>GLMA, GLVA, GLWI, others, have mandatory checks.</li>
		<li>GLTX historical issue with requiring background check is related to Fair Credit Reporting Act. If someone is denied membersip or service because of a background check, they have the legal right to appeal that. However, Masonic law doesn't really provide for appealing a blackball vote. Is it possible that lodges would be open to lawsuits for not complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act?</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Belief in God / Higher Power</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Pretty much non-negotiable</li>
		<li>What about pantheism, polytheism, etc? What does GLTX say?</li>
		<li>Talk with the candidate about this.</li>
		<li>Flying spaghetti monster, Jedism, "science"</li>
		<li>What's Texas' official stance? - unusual</li>
			<ul>
			<li>"Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you firmly believe in the existence of God, <i>the immortality of the soul, and the Divine authenticity of the Holy Scripture?"</i></li>
			<li><a href="/docs/GLTXlaw.pdf">Art. 397. (434).</a> Religious Belief. A firm belief in the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the divine authenticity of the Holy Scriptures is indispensably necessary before a candidate can be initiated, but this Grand Lodge does not presume to prescribe any canonical books or what part thereof are inspired. It is the policy of this Grand Lodge to permit a candidate whose religious persuasion is based upon other than the Holy Bible to be obligated upon the book of his chosen faith, and same may be situated upon the Altar in front of the Holy Bible during the conferral of the three degrees of Masonry. In which event, all esoteric references to “The Holy Bible” during the conferral of the degree(s) and the lessons appropriate thereto shall be substituted with “The Book of your (my) Faith.”
			</ul>
		<li>It's cool to cater to a candidate's religious beliefs, but make sure that you do so respectfully. Let them take the lead on that.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>"Should your religious belief be based upon other than the Holy Bible, please bring the “Book of Faith” appropriate to your religious persuasion when you appear for the conferral of your degrees."</li>

	<li>Waiting Periods</li>
