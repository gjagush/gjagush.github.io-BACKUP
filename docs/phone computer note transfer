Domains that are still available:

TexasRAM.com
TexasRAM.net
TexasRAM.org
TexasRSM.com
TexasRSM.net
TexasRSM.org

Most importantly, texaschapterandcouncil.com isn't taken yet, as ours is the under the .org top level domain.

Should we look into purchasing some of these? I think it would be best for us to own TexasRAM.com, TexasRSM.com, and texaschapterandcouncil.com in addition to texaschapterandcouncil.org (already owned).
