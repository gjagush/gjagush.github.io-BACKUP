Howdy Joe, Howdy Neal.

I was looking into some of the domain names that might be relevant to our Ch/Co website, and I found that there a few available to us that would be pretty useful to have.

Domains that are still available:

TexasRAM.com
TexasRAM.net
TexasRAM.org
TexasRSM.com
TexasRSM.net
TexasRSM.org

Most importantly, texaschapterandcouncil.com isn't taken yet, as ours is the under the .org top level domain.

Should we look into purchasing some of these? I think it would be best for us to own TexasRAM.com, TexasRSM.com, and texaschapterandcouncil.com in addition to texaschapterandcouncil.org (already owned). At the very least, owning the .com version of our existing domain name would be pretty beneficial as most folks are used to using .com domains and not .org domains.

Fraternally,
