Dear Friend,

Thank you kindly for reviewing my second lesson. These are my answers for lesson #3, "The World of Thought."

Answer 1: The two main regions of the World of Thought are the Region of Concrete Thought and the Region of Abstract Thought.

Answer 2: The four divisions of the Region of Concrete Thought / the Second Heaven are the Continental Region, the Oceanic Region, the Aerial Region, and the Region of Archetypal Forces. 

Answer 3: The Continental Region contains the archetypes of physical form, as well as the archetypes of continents and islands. The archetypes of the four ethers that comprise the Etheric Region are found in the Oceanic Region. In the Aerial Region, we can find the archetypes of desires/passions/wishes/feelings/emotions as we do in the Desire World. The Region of Archetypal Forces contains the forces that direct the archetypes of the lower three regions/divisions of the Region of Concrete Thought.

Answer 4: The germinal ideas found in the Region of Abstract Thought are desire and emotion (Fifth Region), lift in plant/animal/man (Sixth Region), and form in mineral/plant/animal/man (Seventh Region).

Answer 5: The Region of Abstract Thought is reflected in the World of Desire, the World of Life Spirit is reflected in the Etheric Region (Physical World), and the World of Divine Spirit is reflected in the Chemical Region (Physical World). 

Answer 6: The World of Desire affects and permeates the Physical World. The World of Thought permeates no affects both the Desire World and the Physical World.
