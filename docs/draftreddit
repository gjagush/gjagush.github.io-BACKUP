There's a couple of issues with that argument, Commander Worf. Let's also not compare transgender individuals to fabulous TNG villains. Anyway...

For full disclosure: while I personally feel more inclined to say that Masons should be "natural-born males," I prefer not to argue for or against that. I'm more in the camp of "if your jurisdiction allows something, then whatever." 

It is true that we are born male or female, anatomically (barring cases of intersex inviduals, which are extremely rare). I would even agree that you can't will your gender to be something else. However, I think it's fallacious to say that physical sex and mental gender are strictly aligned. Don't get me wrong - I fully believe that in 99.7% of the adult US population, this is absolutely the case (Gates 2011). I don't endorse Tumblr-esque notions, but gender-atypical individuals definitely exists. It's important to remember that sex and gender are two different things. Sex is physical, and very evident. There's really no disputing the sex of an individual. Gender is mental and not as obvious. Usually someone's gender is tied to their sex - this is just biology. Sometimes, that isn't the case, and been accepted medical science since the DSM-III was published almost forty years ago. In fact, knowledge of that has existed since ancient times in places like Assyria, India, Greece, etc.

Gender dysphoria is a real, diagnosable condition with a pretty specific set of criteria - you can take at look at adult gender dysphoria in 302.85 (F64.1) of the DSM-V on page 452. Transgender individuals are the people who experience life-long gender dysphoria. In transgender/transexual individuals, the sexually dimorphic regions of the brain is significantly closer to the gender that they are experiencing than the gender that their sex would ordinarily dictate (Rametti 2011) - we can see that there is a physical cause for the mental gender.

Anyway, so the point I'm getting at is that regardless of whether or not we believe that transmen should be allowed to become Masons, it's important not to dismiss it as "make-believe," as you put it.

Stuff that I looked into for this:
