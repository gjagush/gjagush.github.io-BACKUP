> You are born male or female, you can't will your gender to be something else. You are not of the Q Continuum because it is make believe.

There's  couple of issues with that argument. For full disclosure, I'm not really here or there on the issue - in terms of standpoints, I'm in the camp of "if your jurisdiction allows something, then whatever, IDGAF." I personally feel more inclined to side with the definition of "naturally male," but I prefer not to argue for that.
