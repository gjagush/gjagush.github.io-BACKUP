THERE YOU WILL HEAR MUSIC OF ALL KINDS RANGING FROM THE GRAND IMPASSIONED STRAINS OF ISAIAH TO THE WEEPING JEREMIAH. THERE THE GREAT HAND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT SWEEPS THE GREAT KEYBOARD OF NATURE UNTIL IT SEEMS THAT EVERY REED AND PIPE OF GOD`S GREAT UNIVERSE RESPONDS TO THE TUNEFUL SONGS OF DAVID, THAT SWEET SINGER OF ISRAEL. THEN STEP INTO THE BUSINESS OFFICE OF PROVERBS AND NEXT INTO THE CHAPEL OF ECCLESIASTES WHERE THE VOICE OF THE PREACHER WAS HEARD. NEXT IS THE CONSERVATORY OF SHARON WHERE THE LILY OF THE VALLEY`S SWEET SCENTED SPICES WILL FILL AND PERFUME YOUR LIFE. NEXT YOU COME TO THE OBSERVATORY OF THE PROPHETS WHERE YOU FIND A ROOM FILLED WITH MANY TELESCOPES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES FOCUSED OF FAR OFF EVENTS BUT CONCENTRATED ON THE SUNLIT HILLS OF JUDEA WHERE THAT BRIGHT MORNING STAR WILL RISE FOR OUR ETERNAL SALVATION.THEN STEP INTO THE ANTEROOM OF THE KING OF KINGS AND SEE A VISION OF HIS GLORY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, AND JOHN.

AND CLOWNS THAT CAPER IN SAWDUST RINGS
AND ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME

A FORMLESS MASS, AND A BOOK OF RULES;
AND EACH MUST MAKE ERE LIFE HAS FLOWN,
A STUMBLING BLOCK OR A STEPPING STONE.
