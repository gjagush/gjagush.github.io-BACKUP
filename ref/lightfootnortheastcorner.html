  <p>In the notes of Menu, the sacred book of the Brahmans, it is said, "If anyone has an incurable disease, let him advance in a straight path toward the invincible `northeast point,' feeding on water and air 'til his mortal frame totally decays and his soul becomes united with the supreme." It is at the same northeast point, that those first instructions are given in Masonry, which enable the true Mason to commence the erection of the spiritual temple, in which, after the decay of his mortal frame, "his soul becomes united with the Supreme." In the important ceremony which refers to the northeast corner of the Lodge, the candidate becomes as one who is, to all outward appearance, a perfect and upright man in Masonry, the representative of a spiritual cornerstone, on which he is to erect his future moral and Masonic edifice.</p>
<p>This symbolic reference to the corner stone of a material edifice, when, at his initiation, the Mason commences the moral and intellectual task of erecting a spiritual temple in his heart, is designed to impress the idea of acquiring all the qualities that are necessary to constitute a "well formed, true and trusty" corner stone. The squareness of its surface is emblematic of moral force. Its cubic form is emblematic of firmness and stability of character - and the peculiar fineness and finish of the material is emblematical of virtue and holiness; showing that the ceremony, in the northeast corner in the lodge, was undoubtedly intended to portray, in the consecrated language of symbolism, the necessity of integrity and stability of conduct; of truthfulness and uprightness of character, and of purity and holiness of life; which, just at that time, and in that place, the candidate was most impressively charged to maintain.
 In Masonic symbolism the cornerstone signifies a true Mason, and is the first character which the apprentice is made to represent after his initiation has been completed. As every Mason fully understands, the corner stone is the stone which lays at the corner of two walls, and forms the corner of the foundation of an edifice. It is the foundation on which the entire structure is supposed to rest. It is considered by operative Masons as the most important stone in the edifice. It is laid with impressive ceremonies and, for this purpose, Freemasonry has provided a special ritual, which aids in the proper performance of that duty.</p>
<p>Among the ancients, the cornerstone of important edifices was laid with impressive ceremonies, and these are well described by Tacitus, in the history of the rebuilding of the capitol, after telling of the preliminary ceremonies, which consisted in a procession of vestals, who, with chaplets of flowers, encompassed the ground and consecrated it by libations of living water. He adds that, after solemn prayer, Helvidius, to whom the care of rebuilding the capitol had been committed, laid his hand upon the fillets that adorned the foundation stone and also the cords by which it was to be drawn to its place. At that instant, the magistrates, the priests, the Romans, knights and a number of citizens, all acting with one effort and general demonstration of joy, laid hold of the ropes and dragged the ponderous load to its destined spot. They then threw in ingots of gold and silver and other metals which had never been melted in the furnace, and still untouched by human art, and in their first form as they came from the bowels of the earth. The symbolism of the corner‑stone, when duly laid with Masonic rites, is full of significance, which refers to its form, its seat, its permanence, and its consecration.</p>
<p>As to its form, it should be perfectly square on its surface, and in its solid contents, a cube. Now, the square is the symbol of morality, and the cube, of truth. In its situation, it lies between the north, the place of darkness, and the east, the place of light, and hence, this position symbolizes the Masonic progress from darkness to light, and from ignorance to knowledge. The permanence and durability of the corner‑stone, which lasts long after the building, in whose foundation it was placed, has fallen into decay, is intended to remind the Mason that when this earthly house of his tabernacle shall have passed away, he has within, a full foundation of eternal life, a corner stone of immortality, an emanation from that divine spirit which pervades all nature, and which therefore must survive the two and rise, triumphant and eternal, above the decaying dust of death and the grave. The stone, when deposited in its appropriate place, is carefully examined with the necessary implements of operative masonry, the square, the level Ind the plumb, - all symbolic in meaning, - and is then declared to he "well formed, true and trusty." Thus the Mason is taught that his virtues are to be tested by temptation and trial, by suffering and adversity, before they can be pronounced, by the Master Builder of souls, to be materials worthy of the spiritual building of eternal life, fitted, "as like a stone," for that house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. And, lastly, in the ceremony of depositing the corner‑stone, the elements of Masonic consecration are produced, and the stone is solemnly set apart by pouring corn, wine and oil upon its surface, emblematic of the nourishment and refreshment and joy, which are to be the rewards of the faithful performance of duty.</p>
