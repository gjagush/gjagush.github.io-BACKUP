  <p>Founder of the Order of Judas Maccabeus, Brother Herman Sarachan:</p>
  <a href="/posts/20170220-img1.jpg"><img src="/posts/20170220-img1.jpg" height="400"></a>
  <p>My latest obsession is one that I've touched on before in <a href="/posts/20170112.html">the article I shared</a> by R∴W∴ Raymond Beardsley. For those of you that have not yet heard of the Order of Judas Maccabeus, it was an order founded in New York State by a group of brothers seeking a non-Christian alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar_(Freemasonry)">Commandery</a>. The founding of the Order did involve Masons from many aspects of the Craft, including representatives and leaders from the NYS grand bodies of Chapter, Council, and Commandery.
  <p>One of my goals has been to reach out to brothers that were involved in the Order. This has proved to be very difficult. Many of the men involved in OoJM have passed away, or don't have an online presence, which makes reaching out a lot more difficult! When I first read the article by Brother Beardsley, I figured that I should try and see if I could contact him. That is when I found out that he had passed away about two weeks before I had found the article. No luck there, unfortunately, and may Brother Beardsley rest easy in the arms of the Creator.</p>
  <p>Initially, I thought I had reached a dead end. However, having read the article, I had a jumping-off point: the home Chapter and home Council of the OoJM founder, Brother Herman Sarachan. I sent out emails to the recorder of Doric Council #19 and to the recorder of Hiram Chapter #62. My email to Hiram Chapter was a little bit of a Hail Mary, because I wasn't sure if this was a reformation of Hamilton Chapter, or if it was a different entity entirely. As of yet, I still have to hear back from their recorder, so my assumption is that it is a different Chapter entirely. <a href="/posts/20170220.html"><i>[Continue reading The Quest for Judas Maccabeus]</i></a></p>
